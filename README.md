# Water Network Management Harmonized Data Models

## Description
These data models describe entities useful for dealing with Water Network Management data. These entities are primarily derived from the EPANET platform. 

The main entities identified are:

-   [Curve](Curve/doc/spec.md): It defines data curves and their X,Y points.
-   [Junction](Junction/doc/spec.md): It represents junction nodes contained in the network
-   [Pattern](Pattern/doc/spec.md): It represents time patterns.
-   [Pipe](Pipe/doc/spec.md): It represents all pipe links contained in the network.
-   [Pump](Pump/doc/spec.md): It represents all pump links contained in the network.
-   [Reservoir](Reservoir/doc/spec.md): It represents all reservoir nodes contained in the network.
-   [Tank](Tank/doc/spec.md): It represents all tank nodes contained in the network.
-   [Valve](Valve/doc/spec.md): It represents all control valve links contained in the network.
