## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `efficCurve`: The ID label of the curve that represents the pump's wire-to-water efficiency as a function of flow rate.  - `endsAt`: The ID of the node on the discharge side of the pump  - `energyPattern`: The ID label of the time pattern used to describe the variation in energy price throughout the day.  - `energyPrice`: The average or nominal price of energy in monetary units. All units are accepted in [CEFACT](https://www.unece.org/cefact.html) code.  - `energyUse`: Observed energy use by the element of the network  - `flow`: Rate of flow from `startsAt` node to `endsAt` node, measured by a device at the link (pipe, valve or pump)  - `headCurve`: The ID label of the pump curve used to describe the relationship between the head delivered by the pump and the flow through the Pump.  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `initialStatus`: The link status at the start of the simulation. Enum:'OPEN, CLOSED, CV'  - `location`:   - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `power`: The power supplied by the pump. All units are accepted in [CEFACT](https://www.unece.org/cefact.html) code.  - `pumpPattern`: The ID label of a time pattern used to control the pump's operation. The multipliers of the pattern are equivalent to speed settings. A multiplier of zero implies that the pump will be shut off during the corresponding time period  - `quality`: Observed quality in the network component  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `speed`: The relative speed setting of the Pump. All units are accepted in [CEFACT](https://www.unece.org/cefact.html) code.  - `startsAt`: The ID of the node on the suction side of the pump  - `status`: The dynamic state of the node. Enum:'OPEN, CLOSED, CV'  - `tag`: An optional text string used to assign the pipe to a category, perhaps one based on age or material  - `type`: NGSI-LD Entity Type. It must be equal to Pump.  - `velocity`: Observed velocity in the link (pipe, valve or pump)  - `vertices`: Coordinates of all vertices in the pump, ordered from the startsAt node to the endsAt node and encoded as a GeoJSON     
Required properties  
- `endsAt`  - `id`  - `initialStatus`  - `startsAt`  - `type`  ## Data Model description of properties
