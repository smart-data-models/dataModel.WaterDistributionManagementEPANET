## List of properties  

- `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `multipliers`: Multipliers define how some base quantity (e.g., demand) is adjusted for each time period  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `startTime`: The time at which the pattern starts  - `tag`: An optional text string used to assign the pipe to a category, perhaps one based on age or material  - `timeStep`: The time step used for the multipliers. All units are accepted in [CEFACT](https://www.unece.org/cefact.html) code.  - `type`: NGSI-LD Entity Type. It has to be Pattern

## Example payloads    
#### Pattern NGSI-v2 key-values Example    
Here is an example of a Pattern in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
```json
